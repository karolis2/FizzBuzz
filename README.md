# Project Title

This a simple FizzBuzz application.

It consists of console application, tests project and class library.

TDD approach was used and commit history should be able to reflect it. Ideally I should have refactored more in between tests but I decided to do it after the all the conditions were accomplished as I could imagine the end result.

Ideally I would test the application processing function as well. Which make sure that if application was run in range of 100 then the function was executed 100 times.

The repository is on the master branch and should work straight away if you hit F5.

Application is run on .NET 8
